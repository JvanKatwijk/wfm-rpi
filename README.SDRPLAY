A recent change in the sdrplay installer leads to incompatible naming
with previous versions

If you have the most recent version (afaik 14 nov 2015)
uncomment the line
#define	SDRPLAY_LIBRARY_NEW
in the configuration file 

On e.g. the RPI there might be an older version of the library,
in that case comment the line out
